# **Compilation**

To compile simply do make on the src folder.
> make
 
# **Running**

To run the program, call the executable, followed by the flags, permissions and file or directory to apply to.
For example.
> ./xmod -R -c -v a=rwx test.txt
In a more general way
> ./xmod <[-R|-c|-v]> <[a|u|g|o][+|=|-][-|r|w|x] <file or directory>

-R: Uses recursion on the directory\
-v: Provides extra information about every step taken\
-c: Provides extra information when a change to the permissions is made\


 a: Sets the permission for all users\
 u: Sets the permission for the user who owns the file\
 g: Sets the permission for other users in the file group\
 o: Sets the permission for users not in the file group\
\
 r: Sets reading permission\
 w: Sets writing permission\
 x: Sets executing permission
 
# **Errors and input**

There must always be at least 3 arguments (including the program call). The last and second to last will be the file or directory to be affected and the permissions, respectively.

Failure to provide a valid file or directory will yield an error.

Failure to provide a valid mode will yield an error.

Providing wrong flags will yield an error.

Trying to terminate the program will prompt the user.

When changing permissions recursively, the program will output error messages if it encounts a problem with any file in the directory.

  
# **Implementation**
  
1. Set the logfile and signals
2. Parse flags used
3. Get an octal number from the permissions
4. Apply the permission to the given file or directory

When the -R (recursive) flag is applied. Changing the permissions of a directory will be done by forking the proccess. Since a brand new version is created without the same memory space, environment variables are used to verify if the program is a child.
To try and recreate chmod's behaviour, we change the permissions of the directory first and then apply them to the inner files/directories

```
```

In order for the child processes to log correctly, two environment variables were used for:

* Storing the PID of the process created with the first execution of 'xmod'
* Storing the first clock tick of the process created with the first execution of 'xmod'

```
```

When the user uses 'CTRL-C' and decides to end the execution of the program, the parent (oldest) process sends a signal to everyone in the same group (USR2) so they can know they should end their executions aswell. On the contrary, if the user decides not to end the program, a USR1 signal is used to tell its children to return to their normal activity, since they had been waiting until now.
